# dotfiles

Yet another dotfiles repository: configuration and scripts for linux machines (basically debian derivatives).

Includes my functions, environment variables, path, custom prompt with git prompt, and more goodies.

# Setup instructions

When running on a new system, to install development files use

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Lionex/dotfiles ~/.dotfiles && cd ~/.dotfiles && . install.sh
```

To simply symlink the dotfiles, use

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Lionex/dotfiles ~/.dotfiles && cd ~/.dotfiles && . setup.sh
```
